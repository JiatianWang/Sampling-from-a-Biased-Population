# Sampling-from-a-Biased-Population
In this tutorial I will go over some code that recreates the visualizations in the Interactive Sampling Distribution Demo. This demo looks at a hypothetical problem that illustrates what happens when we sample from a biased population and not the entire population we are interested in. This tutorial assumes that you have seen that demo, for context, and understand the statistics behind the graphs.
